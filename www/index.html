     <h3>History</h3>
     <p>
        FlexDock is an open source framework based on the Eleritec docking framework version 0.3.  
     </p>
     <p>
        Version 0.4 of flexdock has been in development since about August 2004 when Eleritic opensourced their framework
        Initial work as been done by Claudio Romano to provide support in <a href="http://www.springframework.org/spring-rcp">Spring Rich Client</a> for FlexDock.
        It is in the Spring Rich roadmap to offer official integration with docking frameworks through a common set of windowing abstractions.
        The basic abstractions are in place and people are extending them as in Claudio's case with FlexDock.

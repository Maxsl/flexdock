        FlexDock is a Java docking framework for use in cross-platform
        Swing applications.  It offers features you'd expect in any desktop docking framework such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
        <li>Tabbed and Split Layouts</li>
        <li>Drag-n-Drop capability (with native drag rubber band painting on some platforms)</li>
        <li>Floating windows</li>
        <li>Collapsible Containers to Save Real Estate</li>
        <li>Layout Persistence</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>History</h3>
     <p>
        FlexDock is an open source framework based on the Eleritec docking framework version 0.3.  
     </p>
     <p>
        Version 0.4 of flexdock has been in development since about August 2004 when Eleritic opensourced their framework
        Initial work as been done by Claudio Romano to provide support in <a href="http://www.springframework.org/spring-rcp">Spring Rich Client</a> for FlexDock.
        It is in the Spring Rich roadmap to offer official integration with docking frameworks through a common set of windowing abstractions.
        The basic abstractions are in place and people are extending them as in Claudio's case with FlexDock.
     </p>
     <p>
        We are looking for developers to improve upon the groundwork laid by Eleritec and our 0.4.0 release.

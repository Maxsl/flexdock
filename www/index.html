    FlexDock was formerly known as the Eleritec docking framework.  We are currently looking for developers to improve upon the ground work laid by Eleritec.  The documentation for Flexdock .3 (Eleritec) can be found at:
    <a href="http://www.eleritec.net/projects/docking.html">http://www.eleritec.net/projects/docking.html</a><p>
    Initial work as been done by Claudio Romano to provide support in <a href="http://www.springframework.org/spring-rcp.html">Spring Rich Client</a> for FlexDock.  It is in the Spring Rich roadmap to offer official integration with docking frameworks through a common set of windowing abstractions. The basic abstractions are in place and people are extending them as in Claudio's case with FlexDock.<p>

    The original Eleritec Demo can be found <a href="http://www.eleritec.net/projects/fakeWSAD.html">here.</a><p>
    
    <b>Downloads</b><br>
    Currently the work on the .4 release of FlexDock is accessible only through CVS.  However, binaries of Eleritec .3 are available on its <a href="http://www.eleritec.net/projects/docking.html">website</a>.<p>

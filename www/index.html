     <p>
        FlexDock is a Java docking framework for use in Swing applications.
        It is based on the Eleritec docking framework 0.3.
        It is released using the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
         We are looking for developers to improve upon the groundwork laid by Eleritec and our 0.4.0 release.
     </p>
     <p>
        Initial work as been done by Claudio Romano to provide support in <a href="http://www.springframework.org/spring-rcp">Spring Rich Client</a> for FlexDock.
        It is in the Spring Rich roadmap to offer official integration with docking frameworks through a common set of windowing abstractions.
        The basic abstractions are in place and people are extending them as in Claudio's case with FlexDock.

Building Flexdock
--------------------------

To build this project, obtain a copy of Apache's Ant from http://ant.apache.org.
You must use version 1.6.0 or later.

From this directory you should be able to build everything just by running the command: ant

This will generate output in the following directories:

  build/bin       The compiled framework and required resource files.
  build/bin-demo  The compiled demos and required resource files.
  build/bin-test  The compiled tests and required resource files
  build/docs/api  The javadoc for the framework.
  build/dist      Contains:
                   - a jar containing just the framework code and
                     it's resources
                   - a zip containing this jar, the license file,
                     plus the PDF docs and the javadoc (i.e. a binary
                     distribution of the framework)
 

Running The Demos
--------------------------

To run the demos, there are several ant targets:

  demo.adapter
  demo.border
  demo.compound
  demo.elegant
  demo.jmf
  demo.perspective
  demo.simple
  demo.splitpane
  demo.tabbedpane
  demo.view

To run a demo, choose the name of the demo target you wish to run and execute it via ant.  For example:

  ant demo.simple

will run the simple demo.

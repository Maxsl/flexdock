To build this project, obtain a copy of Apache's Ant from http://ant.apache.org.  Currently,
the project will build with version 1.5.x, but we will soon require that you use version 1.6.x.

From this directory you should be able to build enverything just by running the command: ant

This will generate output in the following directories:

  bin       The compiled framework and required resource files.
  bin-demo  The compiled demos and required resource files.
  bin-test  The compiled tests and required resource files
  docs/api  The javadoc for the framework.
  dist      Contains:
              - a jar containing just the framework code and it's resources
              - a zip containing this jar plus the javadoc (i.e. a binary distribution of the framework)

To run the demos, there are several ant targets:

  demo.adapter
  demo.border
  demo.compound
  demo.elegant
  demo.jmf
  demo.perspective
  demo.simple
  demo.splitpane
  demo.tabbedpane
  demo.view

To run a demo, choose the name of the demo target you wish to run and execute it via ant.  For example:

  ant demo.simple

will run the simple demo.

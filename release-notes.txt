flexdock 0.5.1 RELEASE NOTES:

CHANGES FROM 0.5:
Updates:
	- The Skin Look and Feel migrated from 1.2.11 to 6.7.
	- The JGoodies Looks migrated from 1.3.1 to 2.1.1.
	
Known Problems:
	- The message "UIDefaults.getUI() failed:" with some stack trace is printed
	  to System.err.  This is not a bug.  This trace is printed from the
	  underlying Swing L&F management.  The flexdock L&F exensions could
	  possibly exist for some L&Fs, so it is preferrable to check with the
	  UIManager before checking with the flexdock extension manager
	  (PlafManager).  If the requested component is not part of the installed
	  L&F, then this message is printed.
	  
Fixed:
	- Updated the build.xml file to produce 1.4 compatible code.  The Javadoc,
	  however, is written for 1.5 as it uses the code tag.

CHANGES FROM 0.4:
New Features:
	- release notes.  Hey, this is a new feature.
	- flexdock now uses Apache Commons Logging for all internal logging 
	  operations.  ACL is included in the flexdock download.  The old logging 
	  package exists, but is now deprecated.
	- added PerspectiveEvents.  These events now fire during various actions 
	  with Perspectives.
	- the ability to resize components by double-clicking on the divider.
	- the ability to maximize a dockable.
	
Deprecated:
	- the org.flexdock.logging package.  Use the Apache Commons Logging instead.
	- org.flexdock.util.Utilities.sysTrue(String) method.  Use 
	  Boolean.getBoolean(String) instead.
	- org.flexdock.docking.adapter.MappingReader class.  This is an
	  implementation detail and should be package-private.
	
Fixed:
	- the dockbar layout when attached to the NORTH side of the frame.
	- null appearing in tab text.
	- a problem with the application shrinking when a L&F was changed.
	- a problem where flexdock would "freeze" when the last view was closed.
	- a problem where the docking ratios were not honored.
	- a possible memory leak when disposing of root windows.
	- a bug when a UI delegate was a member of the installed L&F and not
	  registered as an add-on component.

Partially fixed:
	- JApplet throwing a NullPointerException when floating a dockable.  The 
	  NPE is no longer thrown and the dockables can now float; however, there 
	  is no way to place the dockable back into the JApplet.
	- Perspective drawing problem when switching between 0 and 1 view 
	  perspectives.  Switching between single view perspectives now works and 
	  going from single view to no view also works.  Changing from no view to 
	  single view perspectives does not correctly redraw the single view 
	  perspective.
	- began the long process to upgrade the JavaDoc on classes.  As classes are
	  touched, the documentation is being style modified and missing comments 
	  are added.  Current comments are not yet being checked for validity, but 
	  some that were noticed to be out of date have been updated.

flexdock 0.5 RELEASE NOTES:

CHANGES FROM 0.4:
New Features:
	- release notes.  Hey, this is a new feature.
	- flexdock now uses Apache Commons Logging for all internal logging 
	  operations.  ACL is included in the flexdock download.  The old logging 
	  package exists, but is now deprecated.
	- added PerspectiveEvents.  These events now fire during various actions 
	  with Perspectives.
	- the ability to resize components by double-clicking on the divider.
	
Deprecated:
	- the org.flexdock.logging package.  Use the Apache Commons Logging instead.
	- org.flexdock.util.Utilities.sysTrue(String) method.  Use 
	  Boolean.getBoolean(String) instead.
	- org.flexdock.docking.adapter.MappingReader class.  This is an
	  implementation detail and should be package-private.
	
Fixed:
	- the dockbar layout when attached to the NORTH side of the frame.
	- null appearing in tab text.
	- a problem with the application shrinking when a L&F was changed.
	- a problem where flexdock would "freeze" when the last view was closed.
	- a problem where the docking ratios were not honored.

Partially fixed:
	- JApplet throwing a NullPointerException when floating a dockable.  The 
	  NPE is no longer thrown and the dockables can now float; however, there 
	  is no way to place the dockable back into the JApplet.
	- Perspective drawing problem when switching between 0 and 1 view 
	  perspectives.  Switching between single view perspectives now works and 
	  going from single view to no view also works.  Changing from no view to 
	  single view perspectives does not correctly redraw the single view 
	  perspective.
	- began the long process to upgrade the JavaDoc on classes.  As classes are
	  touched, the documentation is being style modified and missing comments 
	  are added.  Current comments are not yet being checked for validity, but 
	  some that were noticed to be out of date have been updated.

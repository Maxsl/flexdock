Some thoughts.

Is it ok that perspective holds information
views that are RELATIVELY docked to each other.

It seems to be alright but the problem might arise
when some deletes certain view from
the perspective or view becomes undocked and
can no longer be relatively addressed unless
a view is removed or undocked other view takes over
this view and new mapping info (ViewDockingInfo) is added.

Get rid of addView and getView methods as DockingManager got new lovely getRegisteredDockable method!

-> perspective must be aware that a certain view is pinned
-> in case view is not docked to any component but is instead floating
   the perspective should hold information that this view is floating
   and the location (point) of this floating view and also the bounds
   of the window so that when one restores perspective the view is still floating.

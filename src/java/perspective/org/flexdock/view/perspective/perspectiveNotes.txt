Some thoughts.

Is it ok that perspective holds information
views that are RELATIVELY docked to each other.

It seems to be alright but the problem might arise
when some deletes certain view from
the perspective or view becomes undocked and
can no longer be relatively addressed unless
a view is removed or undocked other view takes over
this view and new mapping info (ViewDockingInfo) is added.
